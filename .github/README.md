## Introduction

Currently in Development Phase. Keep Patience!!
</br>
Trying to make development(and Neovim in particular ðŸ˜…) simple.

---

## Dependencies

What you need to have?

- OS - Linux/MacOS/WSL
- [Neovim 0.10.0+, built with LuaJIT](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (Optional)

---

## Installation

### Backup your Existing Configuration

At first, backup your existing neovim configuration
</br>
Follow the below commands to backup:

```sh
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

</br>
If you don't have one or don't care about it, just forget it
</br>
</br>
Mastering manual processes is essential for any programmer!
</br>
So, let's take the time to clone the repository manually(it's easy)

### Clone (Linux/MacOS/WSL)

- Follow one of the following commands. Either one is fine.

```sh
# Directly clone the repository to the ~/.config/nvim folder
git clone https://github.com/prrockzed/nvimDev.git ~/.config/nvim
```

<p align="center">OR</p>

```sh
# Clone the repository and symlink it with your ~/.config/nvim folder
git clone https://github.com/prrockzed/nvimDev.git

# Replace the ~/path/to/nvimDev with your own path
ln -s ~/path/to/nvimDev ~/.config/nvim
```

- Now delete the .git folder to enable adding this to your own repository later

```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```

### Downloading from Releases

Like a specific release? Download from previous releases

- Go to the releases part in the about section
- Click on the specific release
- Download the the source code
- Move the contents of the folder to the nvim repo on your machine

### Getting Started

Wanna start 'nviming'?
</br>
Enter the below command to dive into your programming repo

```sh
nvim .
```

You are good to go now! ðŸ˜Ž
</br>
Enjoy Coding

git checkout -b feature-name
```

4. Make your changes and commit

```sh
# write a meaningful commit message concluding your feature

```

6. Push to the branch
