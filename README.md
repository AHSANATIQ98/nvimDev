### Installation
At first, backup your existing vim/neovim configuration(by moving/renaming etc).
If you don't have one or don't care about it, just forget it.

Clone the repository to the nvim folder using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/prrockzed/nvimDev ~/.config/nvim
```

Now you are good to go!
